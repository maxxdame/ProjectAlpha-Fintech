# ProjectAlpha-Fintech

This was a Robo-advisor my team and I collaborated on for our Fintech class in my Masters of Finance program at Hult IBS in Cambridge, MA, USA. My friend and teammamte, Christopher N. from Germany mainly worked on the code, but we engaged in this project together and I learned a lot from the creation of this robo-advisor.

The Robo-advisor conducted a DCF financial analysis on the SP500 to uncover under-valued gems in the market.
